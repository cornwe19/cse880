Introduction:
    - Basically a multipurpose, low level, cloud based object storage system
    - The key is flexibility of the system
       - intended for use with both large and small store and retrieval operations
       - flexible across varrying load sizes as well
    - Current implementations are good at doing one thing. Each must leave room for scaling up of workload and object storage.
       - Walnut seeks to reduce the number of unused resources in these siloed systems by performing all the tasks they perform well with a single reserve of worker nodes
       - helps to provide access to data stored across systems as well
    - omits support for VMs

Overview:
    - Needs to support the following operations to service HDFS, MObStor and PNUTS
       - Atomic replace (test and set)
       - Atomic, multi-writer append
       - Non-blocking reads
       - TODO: define/make sense of each of these
