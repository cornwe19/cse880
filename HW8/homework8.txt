   a) This algorithm progressively builds longer and longer chains of subsets that retain minimum support for association. In order to keep the the number of new candidate items sets relatively small in each pass of the algorithm the the Apiori algorithm employs a dynamic programing tactic to use prior known large sets to be built on. This ordered chaining allows for only adding candidate sets that extend the previously known large chain while preventing infrequent sets. For example, given an L3={{1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {3,5,6}}, not matching the first k-1 items in order would result in a series of infrequent sets that could not possibly meet minimum support to be kept.
